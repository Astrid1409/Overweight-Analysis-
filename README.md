# Overweight-Analysis-
📖 Overview
This project explores a dataset related to overweight conditions, leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning, and Hypothesis Testing to uncover insights, predict patterns, and analyze trends.

The goal is to better understand the contributing factors to overweight conditions and demonstrate the practical application of data analytics and machine learning techniques.

🛠️ Key Features
EDA: Analyze and visualize trends in the dataset.
Machine Learning: Build predictive models to classify and analyze factors related to overweight.
Hypothesis Testing: Validate assumptions about the dataset using statistical methods.
Insights: Identify key patterns and features influencing overweight conditions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Demographics: Gender, age, height, weight.
Lifestyle Habits: Smoking, alcohol consumption, food frequency, and physical activity.
Medical History: Family history of overweight conditions.
Target Variable: Overweight condition classification.

🧠 Machine Learning Models
The project implements:

Classification Models: Logistic Regression
Feature Engineering: Downsample
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

📈 Hypothesis Testing
Statistical techniques are used to answer questions such as:
The mean number of women with obesity is higher than the mean number of men with obesity?
Men uses motor transportations more than women.
There are more woman with family members that have overweight history than men¶

🛡️ Future Work
Incorporate additional datasets to enhance predictions.
Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.
Explore deep learning techniques for advanced analysis.
